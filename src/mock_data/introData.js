          'Whether Surah Al-Qadr is a Makki or a Madani revelation is disputed.',
          'Makki (majority): Abu Hayyan in Al-Bahr al-Muhti has made the claim that the majority of scholars regard it as a Madani Surah. Al Mawardi says that according to the majority of scholars it is a Makki revelation, and Imam Al-Suyuti has expressed the same view in Al-Itqan. Ibn Mardayah has cited Ibn Abbas, lbn Az Zubair and Hadrat Aishah as saying that this Surah was revealed in Makkah., al-Qadr is believed to have been revealed after Sūrah 80, ʿAbasa. A study of the contents also show that it should have been revealed at Makkah as we shall explain below.',
          'Madani: Ali bin Ahmad al-Wahidi in his commentary says that this is the first Surah to be sent down in Madinah.',
          'According to the majority, this is a Meccan Surah (al-Mawardi (d. 450H), ibn Mardyah, Abu Hayyan)',

          'Its theme is to acquaint man with the value, worth and importance of the Quran. Its being placed just after Surah Al-Alaq in the arrangement of the Quran alone explains that the Holy Book, the revelation of which began with the first five verses of Surah Al-Alaq, was sent down in a destiny making night. It is a glorious Book and its revelation for mankind is full of blessings.',
          'At the outset, Allah says: "We have sent it down." That is, it is not a composition of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah\'s peace and blessing) himself, but Allah which "We" refers to, has revealed it.',
          'Then, it is said that "We sent it down in the Night of Destiny." "Night of Destiny" has two meanings and both are implied here.',
          'First, that it is the night during which destinies are decided; or that it is not an ordinary night like other nights, but a night in which destinies are made or marred. The revelation of this Book on this night is not merely the revelation of a book but an event which will change the destiny of not only the Quraish, or of Arabia, but of the entire world',
          'The other meaning is that this is a night of unique honor, dignity and glory; so much so that it is better than a thousand months. Thus, the disbelievers of Makkah have been warned, as if to say: "You on account of your ignorance regard this Book, which Muhammad (upon whom be Allah\'s peace and blessings) has presented, as a calamity for yourselves and complain that a disaster has befallen you, whereas the night in which it was decreed to be sent down was such a blessed night that a task was accomplished in it for the well being of mankind, which had never been accomplished even during a thousand months of history." This also has been said in ayah 3 of Ad-Dukhan in another way, which we have explained in the introduction to that Surah.',
          'In conclusion, it has been stated that on this night, the angels and Gabriel AS descend with every decree (which in verse 4 of Ad-Dukhan has been described as amr-hakim: wise decree) by the leave of their Lord, and it is all peace from evening until morning; that is, there is no interference of evil in it, for all decrees of Allah are intended to promote good and not evil. This is to and beyond the extent that even if a decision to destroy a nation is taken, it is taken for the sake of ultimate good, not evil.',

          'Its objective is to make the people realize how evil man becomes when he denies the Hereafter, or becomes heedless of it, and also to warn them that in the Hereafter not only their visible and apparent deeds but even the secrets hidden in their hearts will be subjected to scrutiny.',
          'For this purpose, the general chaos and confusion prevailing in Arabia, with which the whole country was in turmoil, has been presented as an argument. Bloodshed, loot and plunder raged on every side. Tribes were subjecting other tribes to raids, and no one could have peaceful sleep at night from fear that some enemy tribe might raid his settlement early in the morning. Every Arab was fully conscious of this state of affairs and realized that it was wrong. Although the plundered bemoaned their miserable, helpless state and the plunderer rejoiced, when the plunderer himself was plundered, he too realized how abject the condition in which the whole nation was involved was. Referring to this very state of affairs, it has been said: Unaware of the second life after death and his accountability before God in it, man has become ungrateful to his Lord and Sustainer. He is using the powers and abilities given by God for perpetrating tyranny and pillage; blinded by the love of worldly wealth he tries to obtain it by every means, however impure and filthy, and his own state itself testifies that by abusing the powers bestowed by his Lord he is being ungrateful to Him. He would never have behaved so, had he known the time when the dead will be raised from the graves, and when the intentions and motives with which he had done all sorts of deeds in the world, will be exposed and brought out before everyone to see. At that time, the Lord and Sustainer of men shall be well informed of what one has done and what punishment or reward one deserves.',
