It is a blessed month, which Allah has obligated you all to fast. During it the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell are closed and the devils are shackled. In it there is a night that is better than one thousand months. Whoever is deprived of its good, then he has truly been deprived.)" An-Nasa\'i recorded this same Hadith. Aside from the fact that worship during the Night of Al-Qadr is equivalent to worship performed for a period of one thousand months, it is also confirmed in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,«مَنْ قَامَ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِه»(Whoever stands (in prayer) during the Night of Al-Qadr with faith and expecting reward (from Allah), he will be forgiven for his previous sins.)'

                text: 'A gathering of the companions at the time of Umar RA yielded to a discussion that concluded that indeed laylatul qadr was with then the last ten nights, such that it could be in the 20-30th night. Ibn Abbas said that it was the 7th of the last ten nights. Upon inquiry as to how he came to this thought Ibn Abbas RA explained that Allah SWT created the heavens and earth in 7 days, there are 7 days in a week, that the sujood is on seven (anatomical parts), the tawaf is 7 times around the kaaba, and even throwing the stone (during hajj) is also seven, amongst other things mention. From this highlighted importance to the number 7 in the sharia it can be an indication to the 27th night being laylatul qadr. Furthermore there are 30 words in surah Qadr and the 27th word is هي (refering to laylatul qadr). The term, laylatul qadr has nine letters (Lam, Ya, Lam, Ta [marboota]. Alif, Lam. Qaf, Daal, Ra) and laylatul qadr itself is mentioned three times in this surah and nine times three is twenty-seven. '
