# Quran Journey - Frontend Application

Quran Journey is a web application designed as an Islamic learning tool. It provides videos and notes for every chapter of the Quran. This repository contains the frontend application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To build the application without opening localhost, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Run Storybook

[`Storybook`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/why-storybook) is a development environment for building UI components in isolation. This is where you can view all built components.

To run Storybook, use:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Note: You do not need to build the application before running Storybook.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:

1. Run npm install again.
2. Ensure your Node version is v18.17.0 or higher.
3. Ensure your React version is 18.2.0.
4. Run npm run build again.
